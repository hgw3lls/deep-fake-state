Realism Post-68’
Inversions -- virtues correct deception ( inversions -- brute negations of the vices they correct. ) -- defences against the treat of epistemic, emotional, moral, and political deception -- sin -- as if every desire satisfied and belief affimed were a further step into darkness, into the quagmire of ideological delusion.

The reality of film lies. Fiction is true ( or, at the very least, fiction has a 'relation to truth') while lies are false (Ranciere 2004c : 36) . 

Committing to the fiction -- beyond the view of deception as a lie -- inhabiting the fiction even more deeply rather than giving it up
deception as the lure to the truth --  To uncover this relationship between realism and deception , we must go beyond the view of deception as a lie that is presented in the form of truth-a dissimulation in which something pretends to be something it is not. 

So why is it that objective facts appear to be losing ground to emotional appeals and outright deception? Part of the answer seems to be that the way we have evolved to acquire knowledge is now confronted by a historically unprecedented informational behemoth: the internet.




Post Truth: Knowledge as a Power Game
The Art of Deception
Definition of Post Truth
"Relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief." it had been selected the word of 2016 by the oxford University and the society for the german language in wiesbaden.

"Dishonesty inspires more euphemisms than copulation or defecation. This helps desensitize us to its implications. In the post-truth era we don't just have truth and lies but a third category of ambiguous statements that are not exactly the truth but fall just short of a lie. Enhanced truth it might be called. Neo-truth. Soft truth. Faux truth. Truth lite." 


It’s who you know, not what you know
While we are reliant on others for this pooled knowledge, we treat it as if it were our own, forming what researchers refer to as transactive memory [www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2013.850148]. This was demonstrated by researchers from Brown University [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27670662] who presented participants with a made-up press clipping detailing a novel scientific discovery. The more confidently the expert in the story expressed their understanding of the discovery, the more confident the reader was of their own understanding.

Of course, this misappropriation of communal knowledge doesn’t convey any actual expertise. This can be exposed by asking someone to rate their understanding of how everyday items like flush toilets or zippers work, both before and after they are asked to explain in detail exactly how they function. It is only after we attempt to explain the mechanism in depth that the shallowness of our knowledge becomes apparent, a phenomenon know as the illusion of explanatory depth [www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0364021302000782].

We can begin to see how mass misconception occurs by observing how our social reliance for knowledge interacts with our social reliance for decision making. In a similar way to how we socially outsource via transactive memory, it’s also mentally efficient for us to observe a herd mentality and follow other’s decisions [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19748818].

While informational cascades can quickly lead to a community accepting a false idea, the fact that many individuals within this group may have disregarded personal evidence in deference to the decisions of others means that, should compelling contradictory new evidence be publicly released, the consensus can quickly and dramatically reverse, much like a stock market bubble bursting.

However, when we analyse evidence, not every source is treated equally. We apply much greater weight to those we like, (even if one source is a friend and the other is an expert [www.journalism.org/2016/07/07/pathways-to-news/]) and we actively disregard information if it’s provided by sources we don’t like [www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627313002705]. Our brain’s confirmation bias also preferentially seeks out sources that conform to our worldview, and by selectively associating with like-minded individuals, we form opinion echo chambers [https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05163], where the informational cascades are formed only on the opinions of similarly minded individuals.

These echo chambers not only form our opinions, but also protect and reinforce them from new information. Furthermore, on an individual level, we can be extremely stubborn when defending our worldview. This was somewhat comically illustrated by an experiment [onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12303/pdf] which showed that we are far more critical of others than of ourselves, to such an extent that simply presenting our own opinions as somebody else’s will cause us to reject them almost 60% of the time. blatant mistruths

And while endeavours such as monitoring news credibility on Facebook and Google [https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-and-google-step-up-efforts-to-combat-fake-news-1486396476] will undeniably help, our understanding of the brain suggests that the best method to changing people’s understanding is through exposing their illusion of explanatory depth.

This is supported by recent studies, that show how extremist views on topics like global warming were tempered by both educating people about the basic mechanisms involved [onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tops.12187/full], or by asking them to explain in depth the mechanism behind their alternative theories [journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612464058].

But understanding that fringe beliefs originate from a place of rationality should give us some hope that science’s overwhelming advantage in explaining the mechanism behind complicated issues can eventually reverse the informational cascades behind many widely-held misconceptions.




Deception
Deception has become the modern way of life. Where once the boundary line between truth and lies was clear and distinct, it is no longer so. In the post-truth era, deceiving others has become a challenge, a game, a habit. High-profile dissemblers compete for news coverage, from journalists like Jayson Blair and professors like Joseph Ellis to politicians (of all stripes), executives, and "creative" accountants. 
Research suggests that the average American tells multiple lies on a daily basis, often for no good reason. Not a finger-wagging scolding, The Post-Truth Era is a combination of Ralph Keyes's investigative journalism and solid science. The result is a spirited exploration of why we lie about practically everything and the consequences such casual dishonesty has on society. 
American society has become permeated from top to bottom by deception. Its consequences for the nature of public discourse, media, business, literature, academia, and politics are profound. With dry humor, passionate fervor, and deep understanding, Ralph Keyes takes us on a tour of a world where truth and honesty are no longer absolutes but mutable, fluid concepts.

-- agencies are attempting to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp online discourse, and in doing so, are compromising the integrity of the internet itself.
(1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and 
(2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on various forums.
(3) Other tactics aimed at individuals are listed here, under the revealing title “discredit a target”:

GCHQ describes the purpose of JTRIG in starkly clear terms: “using online techniques to make something happen in the real or cyber world,” including “information ops (influence or disruption).”
Critically, the “targets” for this deceit and reputation-destruction extend far beyond the customary roster of normal spycraft: hostile nations and their leaders, military agencies, and intelligence services. In fact, the discussion of many of these techniques occurs in the context of using them in lieu of “traditional law enforcement” against people suspected (but not charged or convicted) of ordinary crimes or, more broadly still, “hacktivism”, meaning those who use online protest activity for political ends.

False Flag Operations -- using some of the most controversial techniques to disseminate deception online and harm the reputations of targets. Under the tactics they use, the state is deliberately spreading lies on the internet about whichever individuals it targets, including the use of what GCHQ itself calls “false flag operations” and emails to people’s families and friends. Who would possibly trust a government to exercise these powers at all, let alone do so in secret, with virtually no oversight, and outside of any cognizable legal framework?
Online Covert Actions -- Under the title “Online Covert Action”, the document details a variety of means to engage in “influence and info ops” as well as “disruption and computer net attack,” while dissecting how human beings can be manipulated using “leaders,” “trust,” “obedience” and “compliance”





Cheating is a Sign You Are Losing


All News is Fake. Fake News is a Lie.
Truth unreliable standard against which lies can be measured
So objective truth is an unreliable standard against which lies can be measured. Most lies, of course, involve a distortion of the truth, but so do many innocent remarks. And the notorious difficulty of getting at the truth works to the liar's advantage; since there are so many different versions of reality floating around, another one, invented, won't do any harm -- and may even be more entertaining to boot. 


Those who might have been most adept in identifying a liar from demeanor would have had minimal advantage in the circumstances in which our ancestors probably lived. Serious lies probably did not occur often, because a lack of privacy would have made the chances of being caught high. Such a lack of privacy would also mean that lies would typically be discovered by direct observation or other physical evidence, rather than having to rely upon judgments of demeanor. Finally, in a cooperative, closed, small society, when lies are uncovered the reputational costs to the individual would be high and inescapable.

In modern industrial societies, the situation is nearly the reverse. The opportunities for lying
are plentiful; privacy is easy to achieve, there are many closed doors. When caught, the social
consequences need not be disastrous, for one can change jobs, change spouses, change villages. A damaged reputation need not follow you. By this reasoning we live now in circumstances which encourage rather than discourage lying, when evidence and activity are more easily concealed and the need to rely upon demeanor to make our judgments would be greater. And we have not been prepared by our evolutionary history to be very sensitive to the behavioral clues relevant to lying.

If we grant that our evolutionary history did not prepare us to detect lies from demeanor,
why do we not learn how to do so in the course of growing up? One possibility is that our parents teach us not to identify their lies. Their privacy may often require that they mislead their children about just what they are doing, when they are doing it, and why they are doing it. While sexual activity is one obvious focus of such lies, there might well be other activities which parents want to conceal from their children

My first explanation of why we may be such poor lie catchers is that we are not prepared by our evolutionary history to be either very good lie catchers or lie perpetrators.

An actor is not a liar, but an impostor is.

we often want to be misled, we collude in the lie unwittingly because we have a stake in not knowing the truth.


William Blake  wrote in “Auguries of Innocence”: A truth that’s told with bad intent, Beats all the lies you can invent."



quackery

The contemporary proliferation of bullshit also has deeper sources, in various forms of skepticism which deny that we can have any reliable access to an objective reality and which therefore reject the possibility of knowing how things truly are. These "antirealist" doctrines undermine confidence in the value of disinterested efforts to determine what is true and what is false, and even in the intelligibility of the notion of objective inquiry. One response to this loss of confidence has been a retreat from the discipline required by dedication to the ideal of correctness to a quite different sort of discipline, which is imposed by pursuit of an alternative ideal of sincerity. Rather than seeking primarily to arrive at accurate representations of a common world, the individual turns toward trying to provide honest representations of himself. Convinced that reality has no inherent nature, which he might hope to identify as the truth about things, he devotes himself to being true to his own nature. It is as though he decides that since it makes no sense to try to be true to the facts, he must therefore try instead to be true to himself.


Truth (il)literacy

Common Sense

TRUTH LITERACY is the ability to tell truth from deception. Universal truth literacy is just as important to the health of democracy as reading literacy, because if people cannot “read” the truth they are blind to what the truth really is. The are easily controlled by any politician who uses deception to hoodwink the masses into supporting him and his positions.
TRUTH ILLITERACY is the proximate cause of the disastrous path our country has taken in the last eight years.

Lenin
how did Vladimir Lenin rise to power and consolidate his and the communist party’s iron grip after the Bolshevik Revolution? Some by force, but mostly by the fog of deception. It was he who gave the world this chilling quote:
“A lie repeated often enough becomes the truth.”

If Thomas Paine were alive and writing today, he might repeat his cry that “These are times that try men’s souls,” because in that country a new brand of politics has replaced reason and the common good with something else.

Common Sense did what this pamphlet attempts to do: it allowed an intelligent population to break free from the bonds of deception, by replacing illusion with reality.


 the umbrella concept of deception:
Falsification : creates a fiction
Concealment : hides a secret
Equivocal :dodges the issue

There are three aspects of deceptive messages:
* The central deceptive message, which is usually verbal.
* Ancillary message, which includes both verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication that often reveals the truthfulness of a particular message.
* Inadvertent behaviors which are mostly nonverbal and help to point out the deceit of the sender through a term called leakage.

Deception : a message knowingly transmitted by a sender to a foster a false belief or conclusion the receiver.

A root of deception is accomplished by manipulating information. Buller and Burgoon judge a deceptive act on the basis of the deceiver’s motives, not on the acts itself. Every deceptive acts has at leas three aims, to accomplish a specific task, to establish or maintain a relationship with the respondent, and to “save face”, or sustain the image of one or both parties.
Four messages characteristic that reflect strategic intent :
uncertainty and vagueness
nonimmediacy, reticence, and withdrawal.
Nonimmediacy is a strategy of sombolically removing yourself from the situation.
disassociation
is a way of distancing yourself from what you have done. Levelers, inclusive terms that do this without removing individual choice. Group reference, suggest shared responsibility. Modifiers, downplay the intensity of unwelcome news.
Image- and relationship-protecting behavior
Deceivers in dialogue tend to nod in agreement when the respondent speaks, avoid interrupting and smile frequently.


Lying happens in a dynamic interaction where liar and listener dance around one another, changing their thoughts in response to each other’s moves. Liar behavior includes:

Manipulating information: to distance themselves from the message, so if the message is found to be false, they can extricate themselves. Thus they use vague generalities and talk about other people.
Strategically control behavior: to suppress signals that might indicate that they are lying. For example their face may be more impassive and body more rigid.

Image management: for example by smiling and nodding more.


Why are people easily fooled? Because there exist social contract that al of us will be honest with each others (H. P. Grice, McCornack). The expectation of honesty is a cognitive heuristic, a mental shortcut used to bypass the huge clutter of verbal and nonverbal signals that bombard us throughout every conversation.	Buller and Burgoon are convinced that people who know and like each other are particularly resistant to doubting each others words. They define suspicion as a “ state of doubt or distrust that is held without sufficient evidence or proof”.

The Othello Error: DECEIVER ADJUSTMENT TO SUSPICION
Researcher view deception as a chain of offensive and defensive maneuvers on the part of both participants.” Ongoing conversation just as unexpected stress the accompany deception, respondents’ suspicions can be seen through their own nontypical  behaviors.
Reciprocation is a  process of adjusting communication behavior to mesh with the style of the other. Truth tellers react the same way. When falsely accused or confronted by suspicion, they try to tailor messages that will remove all doubt. Their adaption may strike the respondent as devious self-fulfilling prophecy labeled the “Othello error”.

Common sense offers us no principle by which we may decide systematically in these or other cases. We have no alternative to “weighing the gain of any particular deception against the imperilment of mutual confidence involved in all violation of truth” (p. 316). 


“Beware: some liars tell the truth” – Arab Proverb

In times when deception is demanded and errors are encouraged, the thinker strives to correct whatever he reads and hears. Brecht

--Written in December 1934. In the left-hand columns Brecht quotes, almost verbatim,
the original newspaper reports of the addresses by Göring and Hess. The reference
near the beginning of Göring’s speech is to one SA-Gruppenführer Ernst, who is suspected
of having been involved in the execution of the Reichstag fire. The authenticity
of his testament is disputed. The Winter Aid was a collection, and subsequently a
direct tax, established by the Nazis in 1933 to help the needy. It was later used to
finance rearmament.
On Restoring the Truth
OCTOBER 160, Spring 2017, pp. 137–142.

. . . the wise thing is for us diligently to train ourselves to lie thoughtfully, judiciously; to lie with a good object, and not an evil one; to lie for others' advantage, and not our own; to lie healingly, charitably, humanely, not cruelly, hurtfully, maliciously; to lie gracefully and graciously, not awkwardly and clumsily; to lie firmly, frankly, squarely, with head erect, not haltingly, tortuously, with pusillanimous mien, as being ashamed of our high calling.
				— Mark Twain

An ideology will dictate what your actions or policies are. 
A worldview is more of a perspective or explanation of the way things are

absolutization

The Decay of Lying
For the aim of the liar is simply to charm, to delight, to give pleasure. He is the very basis of civilised society, and without him a dinner party, even at the mansions of the great, is as dull as a lecture at the Royal Society.

Romanticism over Realism

Life imitates Art far more than vice versa.
Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art.

Wilde's essay touched on a profound truth about human behaviour in social situations. The laws of etiquette governing polite society were, in fact, a mask. Tact was merely an elaborate art of impression management."

Wilde uses the term "lying" to mean imagination and expounds upon the virtues of "the cultured and fascinating liar." As "lying" is viewed as something quite immoral and shameful, does Wilde's use of this terminology to mean something admirable take away from the clarity of his argument ?


Lenin (“Truth is not to be found at the beginning but at the end, more particularly within the process. Truth is not the initial impression ” 
The bourgeois account of the “intellectual reproduction of reality, both in the direct mirroring of phenomena as well as in concepts and laws (when they are considered one-sidedly, undialectically, outside the infinite process of dialectical interaction)” (27) is inadequate

 "Read my lips" -- Bush's infamous 1988 pledge not to raise taxes -- and "I didn't inhale" -- Clinton's account of his youthful experiment with marijuana -- have become jokes

"Now, there is something strange and peculiar: people take for granted that they can't trust the government."

Constantly hearing the truth, the cold, hard, brutal unsparing truth, from spouses, relatives, friends and colleagues is not a pleasant prospect. "Human kind," as T.S. Eliot wrote, "cannot bear very much reality." Truth telling makes it possible for people to coexist; a little lying makes such society tolerable. 

Public perceptions to the contrary, it is impossible to prove that more people are lying than did in the past. There is no central clearinghouse of lies, no impartial scorekeeper deciding on the truth or falsity of public statements. Further complicating matters, successful lies, by definition, go undetected. If this truly is a time of unprecedented public lying, then it is also a time of remarkably inept liars, or of liars who don't seem to care if they are caught. 



Hans V. As-If
The mind tends to project or reify its own conceptual constructions, which are primarily evolutionary means of adaptation to a changing world. Whatever and whenever such adaptive ideas serve to help us confront reality, they are regarded as if they were real properties.

 In saying that we should act as if a doctrine were 'true', it
presupposes a perhaps ineffectually non-pragmatist notion of truth. (If we
explicate this occurrence of 'true' in pragmatist terms, we fall into an
infinite regress: 'We should act as if we should act as if, etc. According to
the theory, claims about the utility of holding doctrines, and indeed the theory
itself, will themselves be no more than useful fictions. 

Deb Whitehouse, called "Phoenix Rising":  beliefs that we know are not
true but still come in handy: he called them useful fictions.

three key concepts of Hans Vaihinger: 
the idea of mental fictions as self-contradictory, provisory, conscious, and purposeful; 
the law of the devolution of ideas stating that an idea oscillates between dogma, hypothesis, or fiction; 
the underlying assumption about human consciousness that the psyche constructs thoughts around perceptions like an oyster produces a pearl

When thought deviates only partially from reality (only some elements are neglected), it operates with semi-fictions; full fictions, on the other hand, not only are opposed to facts but they are also self contradictory.

Science, Social Thought, Psychology: 
fiction designating a wide variety:
Newton's gravitational force (a fiction)
Rousseau's state of nature
Goethe's original plant (\textit{Urpflanze})
Freud's unconscious
Whether positive or negative -- implications only gathered from context

Mathematics
HV: fictions have been more and  more used in recent mathematics. Their most famous and  most fertile application was in the measurement of curves by  Descartes, Leibniz and Newton. This is really the classical  example. By means of the fiction of coordinates, of artificial lines (all artificial lines are fictional methods), and by means of  differentials or fluxions, a treatment of curves became possible . 1   The methods of unjustified transference, of zero-cases, of  abstract generalization, etc. are modern mathematical devices.  They were generally known by these names; great mathe-  maticians have always been distinguished by the invention of  devices, and these devices are always, essentially based upon  fictions. Even the drawing of artificial lines is such a device.  Schopenhauer called attention to the fact that no real know-  ledge can be obtained by their means. But such devices are  not meant for this but for practical purposes.   It is upon such devices and fictions that the concepts of the  infinitely large, and of negative, fractional, imaginary and  irrational numbers, are based, all of them serving the purpose of simplifying calculation and all in a strict sense logically contradictory.


Heuristic Value -- Process of ideation
The heuristic value of such fictions reveals the nature of our process of ideation; the apperceptions that we are able to make are largely based upon these contrastive operations. Contradictions result in positive knowledge; by means of subsuming entities under entirely different categories, we are able to see their constituent traits. The whole progress of thought rests entirely upon such antithetic operations or errors: 

Fundamentally, we are dealing with a variation of one and the same basic process, the formation of ideational constructs that are interpolated in the stream of thought in order to assist and facilitate it. And in so far as all thinking ultimately aims at an equation, fictions enable this equation and comparison to be effected where otherwise they would be impossible. (105) 

Kant: 
the products of our intellectual intuition (notions like space and time) are "heuristic fictions"
Thing in itself
That of “thing in itself” is maybe the most representative case of a fiction whose value has been misunderstood, as if it were not merely logical. In dealing with that concept, Vaihinger particularly draws his view, and introduces the question of the subject: 

Only within the world of ideas are there things, things that are causes; in the real world these ideas are but empty echoes. The fiction of the Ding an sich would be the most brilliant of all conceptual instruments. Just as we introduce into mathematics and mechanics ideas which facilitate our task, so Kant introduces a device in the form of the concept Ding an sich, as an x to which a y, the ego, as our organization, corresponds. By this means the whole world of reality can be dealt with. Subsequently the “ego” and the Ding an sich are dropped, and only sensations remain as real. From our point of view, the sequence of sensations constitutes ultimate reality, and two poles are mentally added, subject and object. (VAIHINGER, 1925: 75-76) 


Nietzsche: 
an individuals sense of existing as a unified subject (of having a unified self) is "the fiction that many similar states in us are the effect of one substratum"

Thus, “truth . . . is merely the most expedient error” (emphasis given; 108; see Nietzsche, “On Truth and Lies in a Non-Moral Sense“).

HV: to provide manageable concepts in order to sort out reality

for V: fiction is derived from reality disappearing in the course of history or through an operation of logic -- fiction is self-aware of its fiction

“We see the tendency of the logical function to alter reality and deviate from it. What we must insist upon, consequently, is that even in the elementary logical processes a deviation from reality takes place.”

reality is essentially an ordered system of movements.  Ever since nature presented this side to us, all the subjective  additions which we have made in the form of logical trappings, i.e. the categories in the widest sense of the term, have been more and more clearly recognized as such. And only when these ornaments were laid aside and nature stood before us naked and undistorted, did we ascribe to the psyche itself the additions with which — whether out of unselfish generosity or childish self-deception — it had bedecked the external world.

constructions are better viewed as useful hypotheses rather than representations of objective reality. 

fiction only demands justification in terms of its use

hypothesis oriented towards reality and demands verification

“Kant refuses (A 827, B 855) to apply the expression "hypotheses" to the rational ideas: " If l were to give to what I accept as theoretical truth the name of hypothesis [i.e. if I chose to apply merely the term "hypothesis" instead of " knowledge " to the ideas], an hypothesis being something that I should be justified in assuming [ as real], I should, merely by so doing, be laying claim to a fuller conception of the nature of a cosmic cause and of another world than I could really show. For, even to assume something
as an hypothesis, I must have so much knowledge of it, at least in its qualities, as to be able to imagine [i.e. assume hypothetically] not indeed its conception but its existence. The word Belief, however, indicates only the guidance furnished by an Idea in which the concept like, visc is fictitious" (cf. in explanation A 770, B i98).”

Actual phenomena can be regarded as if they behave in such and such a way, but there is no justification for assuming any dogmatic attitude in which the “as if” turns into “it is”. That is the case when fictions are interpreted as hypotheses. Fictions and hypotheses are methodologically different. Hypotheses are directed towards reality and claim to coincide with it; they demand verification, for they want to be an expression of that reality. Of all possible hypotheses related to a given problem, the most probable one is selected. In the case of fictions, the most expedient one is chosen; there are no truth-claims in this selection process. Fictions then are a circuitous approach, scaffoldings to be demolished. What is untenable as a hypothesis can often render excellent service as a fiction. Hypotheses try to eliminate contradictions; fictions, on the contrary, call logical contradictions into existence. 

Schematic fictions: suppressing aspects of the real
Abstractive thinking cuts its way by suppressing aspects of the real. 

Ordering reality
to substitute randomness for order (men cannot make out the rationale behind the actual world). 

Vaihinger refers to our infatuation with orderly reality in these terms: “Only we must not put any philosophical system in the place of reality, led away by the fact that it seems to us enchanting, ideal, glorious and noble.” (161). Because the laws that govern the real are alien to the human mind, 

Order as well as classifications in general are attained, according to Vaihinger, on the basis of the falsification of reality as given (or rather taken). 


Nietzsche & Necessary illusions
Nietzsche recalls the saying of Voltaire : “ Croyez-moi, mon ami, l’erreur aussi a son m£rite” II, 16: for that reason we must not “ destroy ” such illusions (368) for they are necessary even to the advanced mind, indeed as necessary as fairy tales and make-believe games are to the child 139 (and for the child too his games are conscious self-deceptions) 1 In the advanced mind there develops more and more “the consciousness of illusion” V, 87, indeed a cult of illusion, “if nothing any longer proves to be divine unless it be error, blindness and lies ”, since on these “ life has been arranged ”, V, 275 f. This “ impenetrable net of errors ” is necessary for life XII, 39 ff.

The Problem of Truth
It is intelligible enough, from what has preceded, that “ the problem of the value of truth ”, ceremoniously introduced in Vol. VII, IX ff. (cf. 471, 482) can now be stated ; here Nietzsche places himself not only “ beyond good and evil ” but also beyond truth and falsehood * : “it is nothing but a moral prejudice that regards truth as of more value than illusion . . . there would be no life at all were it not on the basis of perspective valuations and semblances” 55 : “ the perspective is the basic condition of all life” 4, 11. This expression, seldom found up till now, henceforth occurs more frequently: the perspective is a necessary deception which remains even after we have recognized its falsity. In this sense Nietzsche had already V, 294, given to his philosophy the appropriate title of “ perspectivism This is also the sense in which the often quoted passage VII, 21, is to be understood : “ it is now time to substitute for the Kantian question : ‘ how are synthetic judgments a priori possible ? ’ another question : ‘ Why is the belief in such judgments necessary’? — to understand namely that, for the survival of beings like ourselves, belief in the truth of such judgments is necessary : for which reason they may, of course, even be false judgments! . . . They are indeed all false judgments. But belief in their truth is necessary as a superficial optical illusion characteristic of the perspective optics of life

Why should the world in which we live not be a fiction?
The falsest judgments (among which are to be classed synthetic judgments a priori) are the most indispensable ones for us , without giving validity to logical fictions, without measuring reality by the purely imaginary world of the unconditioned, the “self-identical”, without a continual falsification of the world by number, man cannot live — the renunciation of false judgments would be a renunciation of life" 1 12 f. (cf. XIV, 191, 210). The “will to deception ” is to be thus understood 10 f., which indeed is the soul of art (84, 123, 472). “ Whatever be the philosophic standpoint we take to-day, from whatever side we look at it, the mistakenness of the world in which we believe we are living is the most definite and most certain thing we see. . . . And why should the world in which we live not be a fiction ? ” 54-56. Even the most exact and the most positive “science tries to keep us in this simplified, entirely artificial world, invented and falsified to suit us ; and willy-nilly science loves error because it is alive and loves life” 41-42. In this sense, for instance, physics makes use of the atomic theory, though it “ is one of the most thoroughly disproved things that exist ” ; but the atomic theory serves the scientist “ as a convenient tool, as an abbreviation of his means of expression ” 22, 27 f. ; the whole of physics is such an artificial, false, temporarily serviceable “ arrangement” * 24.

Will to illusion, regulative fictions (fictions of logic)

Necessity of fictions: Necessary manipulations | Necessary perspectivism
Nietzsche had realized the utility and necessity of fictions. This realization is evident also in many fragments of Vol. XV : thus he speaks on p. 175 of the “necessity of false values” and according to p. 338 “necessity, causality, expediency” are “ useful illusions ”, for such “ illusions are a necessity if we are to live”; “illusion has a survival-value* for us" 303. Logic, which, like geometry and arithmetic, holds only for Active “ entities " (278), is nevertheless a “ useful ” invention, a good “ aid ”, 273, 275, 288. The categories are “ falsifications " but “clever” and “useful means for bringing order into the world ” 274, 299, 301 : the system of categories, the “ system of falsification on principle” is, nevertheless, “a serviceable and handy scheme,” a system of necessary “manipulations”* (300), a “necessary perspectivism 

The Will to appearance: metaphysical deception
Nietzsche finds himself confronted with Descartes’ problem of a deceiving God : — the erroneousness of our con- ceptual world remains a fact : “ We find a superabundance of evidence for that which might seduce us into making guesses at a deceiving principle in the ‘nature of things’” VII, 54. “What if God is a deceiver, in spite of Descartes?” XIII, 10 : “ Let us assume that there is something deceptive and fraudulent in the nature of things. . . . We should, in that case, as a reality, have to participate, to some extent, in this deceptive and fraudulent basis of things and in its basic will ...” XIII, 52 f. : “Descartes is not radical enough. In face of his desire to have certainty and his ‘ I will not be cheated ’, it is necessary to ask why not?” (Ibid., 56, 68). “The starting- point : irony against Descartes : given that there was some- thing deceiving in the basis of things from which we have sprung, what good would it do de omnibus dubitare! It might be the best way of cheating ourselves” XIV, 326. From this it follows that: 

“The will to appearance, to illusion, to deception ... is deeper, * more metaphysical ’, than the will to truth” Ibid., 369 and “the deceptive perspective character belongs to existence” (Ibid., 40); we must “not forget to include this perspective, assumptive force in * true Being ’ ” XV, 321 : “This creating, logicizing, arranging, falsifying, is the best guaranteed reality” Ibid., 281, “so that we might be tempted to assume that there is nothing else but concept-making, i.e. falsifying subjects.” — In the same passage Nietzsche sums up his doctrine in the following monumental words: ” Parmenides said : ‘ We do not think that which is not ’ — we at the other extreme say : ‘ What can be thought must certainly be a fiction ’ ” Cf. the very similar passages in Lange (above pp. 335i 337) °n the value of that which is non-existent and yet thought, Le. of appearance. From this standpoint, appearance is no more to be censured and attacked by philosophers as heretofore (cf. VII, 55), and illusion, so far as it proves itself to be useful and valuable and at the same time aesthetically unobjectionable, is to be affirmed, desired and justified. “ Perspectivism ” is “ necessary " for us XV, 321.

On Lying
The writings of his youth . . . the remarkable fragment dating from the year 1873, Ueber Wahrheit und LUge im aussermoralischen Sinne (X, 189-215). “Lying, in the extra-moral sense”, is what Nietzsche, with his well-known fondness for forced expressions, calls the conscious deviation from reality to be found in myth, art, metaphor, etc. The intentional adherence to illusion, in spite of the realization of its nature, is a kind of “ lie in an extra-moral sense ” ; and “ lying ” is simply the conscious, intentional encouragement of illusion.

Untruth
The writings of the middle or transitional period . . . he extravagant expression “lie” now only occurs rarely. II, 5, 162 (“the Greeks intentionally invested life with lies”); III, 105 (“ the Muses as liars, the artist as a deceiver ”) IV, 1 19 ; (“ the lies and deceits of sensation ’’) V, 309 (" Education, which sanctifies so many lies”) XI, 45, 330, 408. He remarks pathetically in XII, 48: “Ah, now we must embrace untruth, now at last error becomes a lie, and lying to ourselves a necessity of life.”

The thought that we must consciously make use of “ untruth ” in our thought still causes him suffering : “ One question there is that seems to lie like lead upon our tongues and yet never becomes articulate: the question whether we can consciously remain in falsehood and, if we must, whether death would not be preferable?” (II, 51). Again in V, 142, “the recognition of delusion and error as a condition of knowingand feeling” would without art “be unendurable” and must lead to suicide.” But his realization of the fact that ideas, of whose untruth we are conscious, are biological and theo- retical necessities becomes more and more clear At first this realization declares itself in the recognition that "errors and mistakes of fantasy are the only means by which man- kind has gradually . . . been able to elevate itself” (47, III, 228 ; cf. also IV, 97, XI, 36) : Man must, however, “ under- stand not only the historical” but also “the psychological legitimacy [which therefore applies also to the living] of such concepts” (38); he must realize that the engine, man, “ has to be stoked with . . . illusions, one-sided truths (236). 

The order of the world
Because deception and falsification is necessary for life, at least as necessary as true ideas, not only is man, according to Nietzsche, adjusted to it, but all organic life also : “ illusion . . . begins with the organic world ” XIII, 228 : “ thus mankind and all organic beings have made it ; thev have gone on ordering the world, in action, in thought, in imagination, until they have made of it something that they can use, something that they can reckon with," Ibid,, 84; “ the capacity to create (to form, invent, imagine) is the fundamental capacity of the organic world” /bid., 80; “ in the organic world error begins : things, substances, attributes, activities . . . these are the specific errors by means of which organisms live," 60, 63. But man is not content with these minor falsifications — “It is the major falsifications and interpretations that in the past have lifted us above mere animal happiness” 29. In this sense Nietzsche in XIII, 37 already calls man “ the fantastic animal ”and speaks XI, 278 of the “ impertinence of our fantasy ” , the importance of fantasy is stressed in XII, 36; from it springs our “myth-making instinct," Ibid , 123 and the whole “ picture-language " of science, 147, our whole “idealistic phantasmagoria", Ibid., 3, which, however, as conscious “lying", is a necessary element in life XIV, 269.

Godard (every cut is a lie) -- the assumption here is that the narrative function, a priori so to speak, excludes (represses, conceals, silences, abjects, devalues, disavows) everything that is not functional for the movement from the initial to the concluding equilibrium. Assume now that a state of equilibrium is always either a fiction (the way a frictionless surface is a fiction) or a state of human mortification dressed as satisfaction or satiation, then the movement from original to final equilibrium is a movement from one ideality to another ideality (one dead state to another). The conclusion then becomes irresistible that classic cinematic narratives are fictions, where being a fiction is equivalent to being: a mystification, ideology, lie, deception, illusion, representation -- death.

Double structure of post-68' fiction -- “Especially since May 1968, the attack on fiction has been given political rationale (fiction = mystification = bourgeois ideology) but, at the beginning, it is much more closely connected with Godard’s fascination (Cartesian, rather than Marxist) with the misleading and dissembling nature of appearances, the impossibility of reading an essence from a phenomenal surface, of seeing a soul through within a body of telling a lie from a truth.”

Neuroscience of Deception
A study [www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.4426.html] recently published in the journal Nature Neuroscience found that each individual lie desensitizes the brain just a little bit more to the guilt-inducing effects of dishonesty.
-- Dishonesty is an integral part of our social world, influencing domains ranging from finance and politics to personal relationships. Anecdotally, digressions from a moral code are often described as a series of small breaches that grow over time. Here we provide empirical evidence for a gradual escalation of self-serving dishonesty and reveal a neural mechanism supporting it. Behaviorally, we show that the extent to which participants engage in self-serving dishonesty increases with repetition. Using functional MRI, we show that signal reduction in the amygdala is sensitive to the history of dishonest behavior, consistent with adaptation. Critically, the extent of reduced amygdala sensitivity to dishonesty on a present decision relative to the previous one predicts the magnitude of escalation of self-serving dishonesty on the next decision. The findings uncover a biological mechanism that supports a 'slippery slope': what begins as small acts of dishonesty can escalate into larger transgressions.

Deceiving Others: Distinct Neural Responses of the Prefrontal Cortex and Amygdala in Simple Fabrication and Deception with Social Interactions
Abstract -- Brain mechanisms for telling lies have been investigated recently using neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. Although the advent of these techniques has gradually enabled clarification of the functional contributions of the prefrontal cortex in deception with respect to executive function, the specific roles of subregions within the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions responsible for emotional regulation or social interactions during deception are still unclear. Assuming that the processes of falsifying truthful responses and deceiving others are differentially associated with the activities of these regions, we conducted a positron emission tomography experiment with 2 (truth, lie) × 2 (honesty, dishonesty) factorial design. The main effect of falsifying the truthful responses revealed increased brain activity of the left dorsolateral and right anterior prefrontal cortices, supporting the interpretation of previous studies that executive functions are related to making untruthful responses. The main effect of deceiving the interrogator showed activations of the ventromedial prefrontal (medial orbitofrontal) cortex and amygdala, adding new evidence that the brain regions assumed to be responsible for emotional processing or social interaction are active during deceptive behavior similar to that in real-life situations. Further analysis revealed that activity of the right anterior prefrontal cortex showed both effects of deception, indicating that this region has a pivotal role in telling lies. Our results provide clear evidence of functionally dissociable roles of the prefrontal subregions and amygdala for human deception.

Brain Substrates of Recovery from Misleading Influence
Abstract -- Humans are strongly influenced by their environment, a dependence that can lead to errors in judgment. Although a rich literature describes how people are influenced by others, little is known regarding the factors that predict subsequent rectification of misleading influence. Using a mediation model in combination with brain imaging, we propose a model for the correction of misinformation. Specifically, our data suggest that amygdala modulation of hippocampal mnemonic representations, during the time of misleading social influence, is associated with reduced subsequent anterior–lateral prefrontal cortex activity that reflects correction. These findings illuminate the process by which erroneous beliefs are, or fail to be, rectified and highlight how past influence constrains subsequent correction.

Neural correlates of deception: lying about past events and personal beliefs
Abstract -- Although a growing body of literature suggests that cognitive control processes are involved in deception, much about the neural correlates of lying remains unknown. In this study, we tested whether brain activation associated with deception, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), can be detected either in preparation for or during the execution of a lie, and whether they depend on the content of the lie. We scanned participants while they lied or told the truth about either their personal experiences (episodic memories) or personal beliefs. Regions in the frontal and parietal cortex showed higher activation when participants lied compared with when they were telling the truth, regardless of whether they were asked about their past experiences or opinions. In contrast, lie-related activation in the right temporal pole, precuneus and the right amygdala differed by the content of the lie. Preparing to lie activated parietal and frontal brain regions that were distinct from those activated while participants executed lies. Our findings concur with previous reports on the involvement of frontal and parietal regions in deception, but specify brain regions involved in the preparation vs execution of deception, and those involved in deceiving about experiences vs opinions.

Neuroscience, self-understanding, and narrative truth
Recent evidence from the neurosciences and cognitive sciences provides some support for a narrative theory of self-understanding. However, it also suggests that narrative self-understanding is unlikely to be accurate, and challenges its claims to truth. This article examines a range of this empirical evidence, explaining how it supports a narrative theory of self-understanding while raising questions of these narrative’s accuracy and veridicality. I argue that this evidence does not provide sufficient reason to dismiss the possibility of truth in narrative self-understanding. Challenges to the possibility of attaining true, accurate self-knowledge through a self-narrative have previously been made on the basis of the epistemological features of narrative. I show how the empirical evidence is consistent with the epistemological concerns, and provide three ways to defend the notion of narrative truth. I also aim to show that neuroethical discussions of self-understanding would benefit from further engagement with the philosophical literature on narrative truth.

Neuropsy-phi
FICTION AS SIMULATION AND / OR SIMULACRA  “Fiction is the simulation of selves in interaction. Fiction can be thought of as a form of consciousness of selves and others that can be passed from an author to a spectator, and can be internalized to augment everyday cognition”. 

“Fiction might be dismissed as observations that lack reliability and validity, but this would be a misunderstanding. Works of fiction are simulations that run on minds. They were the first kinds of simulation. All art has a metaphorical quality: a painting can be both pigments on canvas and a person. In literary art, this quality extends to readers who can be both themselves and, by empathetic processes within a simulation, also literary characters. On the basis of this hypothesis, it was found that the more fiction people read the better were their skills of empathy and theory-of-mind; the inference from several studies is that reading fiction improves social skills. In functional magnetic resonance imaging meta-analyses, brain areas concerned with understanding narrative stories were found to overlap with those concerned with theory-of-mind. In an orthogonal effect, reading artistic literature was found to enable people to change their personality by small increments, not by a writer's persuasion, but in their own way. This effect was due to artistic merit of a text, irrespective of whether it was fiction or non-fiction. An empirically based conception of literary art might be carefully constructed verbal material that enables self-directed personal change”.




HIERARCHICAL TEMPORAL MEMORY. The cortex has been proposed to be hierarchical prediction machine.  

Top-down or bottom-up flows of input streams and predictive stream constitute the basic functioning principles but it is not in isolation. The cortex is a continuum with the fiction. 

DISCOVERY & INVENTION. The hypothesis tries to discover, the fiction, to invent.

IMAGINATION INFLATION. The construction of imaginary memories that did not happen. But is this actually true ? it might have happened in the future , prospective memory. Remembering the future guides our actions. Positive illusions and delusions use reinforcement learning to chart novel neuronal pathways encoding “facts”.  

Fiction as facts and facts as fiction. 


INFORMATION BOTTLENECK. The idea of an information bottleneck in neural systems taking control in modulating the entropy of intelligence. The attentional bottleneck is the one modulating the cognitive hyper-activation. 

The brain and the behavior -- separate 

Is there such a thing as cyclical memory ? A memory that is self-referential in nature adopting cyclical times as freezed moments , screenshots, deccelerated fiction-reality. 

INTERPRETIVE MEMORY. Emotions are disorders, distortions biasing memories and our interpretive capabilities. Interpretive memory is the recall of the interpretation of a particular instant. The interpretative systems is the one handling contextuals increasing the combinatorial complexity of fiction. 

MEMORY DISTORTION. Memory distortion phenomenon: our memories are never totally accurate, glitches are introduced over multiple timescale. Several types of memory distortions – imagination inflation, gist-based and associative memory errors, and post-event misinformation – reflect adaptive cognitive processes that contribute to the efficient functioning of memory, but produce distortions as a consequence of doing so. The post-event misinformation is pretty relevant today as it deals with the multitude of information streams that follows an event. The information streams compete for the subjects’ memory to be encoded and consolidated. A great deal of social conformity plays into the selection of information streams. Misinformation is the continuous fluid state of information flux. 
A partial list of techniques for memory distortion includes misinformation, outcome information, semantic relatedness, suggestion,imagination, and more subtle manipulations such as subliminal repetition and unscrambling. Each of these techniques reveals the inherent fallibility of memory. What’s memory at the end ? may be just a futile extension of extended distributed narrative networks?  

MNEMONIC CONVERGENCE / SOCIAL CONTAGION / COLLECTIVE REMEMBRANCE. It is safe to claim that memory is well-designed for the formation of collective memory is that there are a variety of mechanisms and processes that will lead to mnemonic convergence, in spite of the dissonance that exists among rememberers.  Through acts of social remembering individuals become vulnerable to incorporating details about the past that they did not actually experience. That is, conversations can serve as a mechanism enabling the spread of a memory from one person to another. This process is often referred to as social contagion.  Collective memory is inherently selective (Rajaram and Pereira-Pasarin, 2010; Hirst and Echterhoff, 2012). When people recall the past some details are retrieved while other fail to enter into conversation.

Collective memory is fiction.
NARRATIVE FICTION “. . . literary narratives offer models or simulations of the social world via abstraction, simplification, and compression. Narrative fiction creates a deep and immersive simulative experience of social interactions for readers. This simulation facilitates the communication and understanding of social information and makes it more compelling, achieving a form of learning through experience. Engaging in the simulative experiences of fiction can facilitate the understanding of others who are different from ourselves and can augment our capacity for empathy and social inference.”

Fiction is a social simulation tool continuously supplementing the imaginary with images of others, images of reality, etc . . .

Fantastic confabulations reveal a dysfunction of the Supervisory System.
-- Emil Kraepelin

COSMETIC PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY. What does truth will even mean in a future dominated by immersive virtual reality lensed in through tools of augmented cognition ?

Why do we even care about the truth ?  One can call the obsession with finding the truth “the truth seeking syndrome”. Truth seeking is pathological . Truth seeking maps onto and resembles delusional schizophrenia.  The split brain is the brain .   

Interfacing with the collective memory is the key to modulate the flow of narratives. The flow of narratives is the news. The term “news” is obsolete. 

An interface acting as a vehicle for narrative. An interface that deals with a delusional self . 


What we see as truth or reality, is a representational model. -- consciousness is also a function of the Ego-Tunnel -- we must live lives made of functional appearances.

PSEUDOMEMORY / FALSE MEMORY SYNDROME. A pseudomemory of having been awakened by some loud noises during a night of the previous week was suggested to 27 highly hypnotizable subjects during hypnosis. Post-hypnotically, 13 of them stated that the suggested event had actually occurred.

Memory systems can almost be fully controlled by capitalizing on the differential temporalities that it employs.  The problem is that of timescales , our brains have developed efficient mechanisms for time scale separation . Temporality is the locus of control. 

AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY. Distortion is the rule for memory systems in human beings. 

“In a unique memory-distortion study with people with extraordinary memory ability, individuals with highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM) were as susceptible as controls to false memory. The findings suggest that HSAM individuals reconstruct their memories using associative grouping, as demonstrated by a word-list task, and by incorporating postevent information, as shown in misinformation tasks. The findings also suggest that the reconstructive memory mechanisms that produce memory distortions are basic and widespread in humans, and it may be unlikely that anyone is immune. The assumption that no one is immune from false memories has important implications in the legal and clinical psychology fields, where contamination of memory has had particularly important consequences in the past.” 

COLLECTIVE AMNESIA / COLLECTIVE RETROGRADE AMNESIA / SOCIAL HIPPOCAMPUS. When consolidation is disrupted by traumatic injury to a brain structure known as the hippocampus, memories in the process of being consolidated are lost. In individuals, this is known as retrograde amnesia. The authors hypothesize a "social hippocampus" and argue that disruption at the collective level can result in collective retrograde amnesia. They offer the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) as an example of trauma to the social hippocampus and present evidence for the loss of recent collective memory in mainland Chinese populations that experienced the Cultural Revolution.
The collective retrograde amnesia in our contemporary societies are dominated by nostalgia for lost futures that were annulled by neoliberalism. Hauntology emerges as a descriptor for the process of the emergence of a deferred non-being that is neither alive nor dead nor present not absent. 

EXTERNAL MEMORY / TRANSACTIVE MEMORY / NEURAL MEMORY PROSTHETICS. The Internet has become a primary form of external or transactive memory, where information is stored collectively outside ourselves.  In many of its formulation, internet has become kind of memory prosthesis extending the capacity, the fiction-ability of the internal neural memory.  Neural prosthetics for cognitive enhancement and memory boosting are being developed through either invasive or non - invasive neural stimulation modalities.  
The fiction-ability is the capability to generate and process fiction as extension to the future. Building what we call “the imaginarium” relies on extensive fiction-ability.  The imaginarium is the hyper-space in which imagination is imagined and unfolded creating a multiplicities of fictional lines of narratives . 

FACTS AS FRAME. Facts are also memories that are subjected to the same cognitive processes. Frames incoming information as fiction or facts. What if the context is blurred , fiction become the mode of information exchange. 

The post-event misinformation

“. . . narratives able to effectuate their own reality through the workings of feedback loops, generating new sociopolitical attractors. This is the aesthetic side of the task of constructing a new sociotechnical hegemony.”
